# Advent 2023

This repository is my attempt at the [advent 2023 challenge][advent-2023]. This is the first time I do attempt.
I did start the project in late May 2024.

I do use this challenge to get familiar with rust and learn something new. I do know that my code is far from perfect and I have seen a lot smarter solution on reddit, but this is fine.
